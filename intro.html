Why do we have fewer women in computer science?</h1>

<p >
The future is being written in lines of code. And the female audience, despite being a user of apps, social networks and digital devices, does not participate in the production of the technology. We need to talk about women's challenges in the area and what to do to increase their participation.</p><p>

Dolls X Computers
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Think fast: what was your favorite toy? It is likely that if you are a woman, the answer is doll or cliques. If you are a man, you possibly answered the question by remembering video games or computers. This division, considered natural by many, reflects historically constructed gender stereotypes, which delegate tasks and interests related to the sphere of care and the private sphere to girls from an early age. “I couldn't play with my cousins ​​and brothers. I was presented with dolls and pink objects, which I detested ", says systems analyst Larissa Pereira Gambale, 22 years old. Product designer Lucía Salamanca, 27 years old, got tired of hearing:" you can't be the same to the boys "," look, he scratched his knee ... It looks like a kid! "," Try to be more feminine ... ".
</p>
<p>
Despite being overthrown by science, the idea that biological reasons determine the different paths of boys and girls still persists. According to this perception, women would have a “natural” ability for activities that require attention and affection, but not rationality, an attribute considered masculine. There are subtle differences in the size and composition of the male and female brains, it is true. The relationship between them and their behavior, however, remains unknown. It is worth remembering that brain structure and function change in response to experience, so that any differences can be related to differences in your socialization and education. "The way our society thinks and defines what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a man is directly related to the development of its skills and competences", says sociologist Bárbara Castro, author of a doctoral research that investigated the female presence on thee.

<p>
Such division affects the ways of being of men and women, influencing future choices, including professional ones. It is not by chance that it is unusual to see girls who identify early on with technological and exact science careers. In her study, Bárbara found that all of her interviewees sought a justification of interest in the area supported by inspiration from someone close to them who had chosen this career and showed them how it could be interesting. Men, on the other hand, when asked how and when they became interested in IT, replied that they always liked technology and machines. "It is a path that presents itself as natural. For them, something to be explored", says Bárbara.
</p>
<p>
“My family even tried to focus my activities on more feminine things, but they always supported me to explore whatever I wanted. I would like to take the dolls apart to, for example, remove the motor and make a fan. ”

According to the researcher, this construction spans generations. English feminists, for example, have already demonstrated how a relationship between technology and masculinity has historically been established. “When, in the industrial revolution, in the 19th century, productive work was separated from the space of the house and men started to act more massively in industrial work, they were the ones who manipulated the machines, developed them and perfected them”, he continues she.
</p>
<p>
The association between technology and masculinity continues to distance IT girls. They suffer prejudice from friends, colleagues and society when making choices linked to the male universe. "They are often accused of being homosexuals, which should not be a problem in itself", concludes Bárbara. “My father forbade me to use any male toys. I once got a top and he threw it away. I thought I could become ‘dyke’ !. When he decided to go to IT college, luckily he didn't know what it was ”, says Tuany Fortunato, 26 years old. And what about the stereotype of the intelligent programmer, but without a lot of social skills, that stick to writing code nights? “It is difficult to identify with something that we are not”, says Sílvia Amélia Bim, a professor at the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR) and one of the coordinators of Emílias - Armação em Bits, a project that aims to encourage technology as a career option for girls , in addition to supporting those already in higher education.

The masculinization process of information technology, more precisely, the figure of the anti-social geek, developed in the 1960s, from the institution of formal programs of the discipline, magazines and professional societies and certification programs. In other words, it has little to do with intellectual abilities of biological origin, but with corporatism. Who tells this story is Nathan Ensmenger, a professor at Indiana University, in the United States, in the book The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of Technical Expertis.

At the same time, new hiring tools - including seemingly objective ones - have strengthened the male presence in the area. The tests favored mathematical problems, the resolution of which was available from university associations and organizations of programmers. Another type of assessment, the personality profile, leaned even more towards male candidates. Based on a series of questions, drawn up by recruiters, these tests sought to identify the best, having as reference the personality traits of white collar professionals (office workers, lawyers, accountants, for example), with one distinction: the employee ideal had "disinterest in people" and disliked "activities involving personal interaction". 
</p>
<p>
And that was how information technology, the subject of a report by Cosmopolitan magazine, which, in 1967, encouraged women to join the area, became male territory.

The idea that many of the computer professions were historically common for girls and were in fact 'female' occupations seems extraordinary, if not unbelievable. "And yet, a historical understanding of how the computing professions acquired their gender identity, how they were" made male "is central to any attempt to tackle the current imbalance," writes Ensmenger.
