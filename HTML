	What is HTML?

<p>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
Unlike a scripting or programming language that uses scripts to perform functions, a markup language uses tags to identify content.
It was created together with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to make possible the internet to be popular.
It was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee in Switzerland. In the beginning it was created to use between research institutions. In 1992 was developed the world wide web which made the HTML possible for the whole world.</p>
<p>
This language has codes that defines what kind of letters, the size, colour, space, border, among others.  The entire HTML has languages that forms layers of web development. When accessing a web page with a reduce interface, in most cases, it is applied through 3 layers with different functions. Each layer is represented by a specific language. So, we can conclude that HTML does not work alone.
We can say that HTML is the first layer. In this part we assign the semantics to the content. It is where we can define that certain information is paragraph, title, or that certain text is an article, etc. The HTML is responsible for displaying the content giving the meaning. </p>
<p>
	After the first layer we use the CSS which is the language for styling, formatting. When you see text with a certain style, a page with a certain background colour or a block wrapped around a border, we can say that this was achieved with CSS. 
CSS selects an element of HTML to style it and present it as a new form in the browser.
The third layer is JavaScript which adds dynamic behaviours to the page. When the user is in contact with the interface of a page, he can at any time perform an action that results in behaviour on the page. Many of these results are due to triggering scripts created by the JavaScript language. An example of how JavaScript works in a page is when we are filling out a form and type the wrong email, JavaScript can warn us that the email is wrong.
So, HTML can be the base of a sophisticated webpage, so is very  important to learn. It is so important that both CSS and JavaScript link HTML elements, classes or identifiers in their code, so that an action can be performed within the HTML file.</p>
<p>
When it comes to working with HTML codes, we have in mind that there is a logical way to arrange the character set for building these codes that will show the content. It is about syntax.
 The way worked in HTML is through tags. Tags are specific marks, instructions that delimit the content and tell the browser what kind of information it is (a title, a paragraph, a list). When you see a visual element on a web page, from a text, a photo or a video, know that they are inserted through tags. Every tag contains a name (brand name) and it also gives the HTML element a name. They are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. From there we can conclude that HTML elements are built by tags. 
Elements specify how HTML documents are to be constructed. Through them, it is possible to determine what type of content and where it, within the HTML document, can be inserted and convey semantic meaning to the inserted content. </p>
