What is CSS?</h1>

<p>
CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets.</b></p>
<p>
	It is a specification that defines how the elements that make up a page, document or web application will be displayed.
</p>
<p>

When we talk about accessibility, performance and maintenance, the principle is to separate the content, interactivity and presentation of a website or web application. CSS plays a big role in the presentation layer.
</p>
<p>
The right way to publish a web document is to follow a semantic structure. CSS brings all the information of the layout, that is, colors, positioning, fonts, sizes and background images, while HTML must provide an "architecture" for the content. Support for CSS by today's browsers is quite solid, but started off timidly, being initially supported by the Netscape browser. The first version of the specification was released in 1996 and a second version published in 1998 but until 2009 not all browsers in use fully supported their resources. A new version of the specification is under development and luckily the latest browsers are already testing it.
</p>
<p>
As the Internet Explorer browser took a long time to support all CSS resources, web developers and web designers used tables to assemble the structure of the pages and all the style information was next to the content. With the improvement of internet speeds (in times of dial-up connection), it was possible to adopt more complex and modern layouts, still using tables. A myth was created that projects using CSS were very simple, clean and “square”. This myth was unraveled when other browsers came into use and support for the new specifications was implemented in Internet Explorer. Another factor that contributed a lot to the adoption of new technologies for CSS was the growth in the use of mobile internet in which the pages need to be light and the content presented correctly on different devices, which would not be possible with tables.
</p>
<p>
How it works? Why “cascade”?
</p>
<p>
The word “cascade” in the name is given by the modularity of the specification: In a document you can have several CSS files, carrying different rules that refer to multiple or the same elements.
</p>
<p>
An important concept for the operation of CSS is the model of blocks and elements "inline". An element within a CSS formatted HTML document consists of a block, a rectangle. Within this block there is a margin, a border and a padding around the content and through some properties we can change their sizes, colors, background images and styles. When a block element is placed next to another, by default each element uses all of its available width and breaks the line before and after itself. Within the block elements there may be other block elements or “inline” elements, those that occupy only their necessary width and do not create lines before and after themselves (links, abbreviations, a label or form element for example).
</p>
<p>
Perhaps because of this concept, the myth that layouts made with CSS are just “squares” has
persisted for so long.
</p>
<p>
What are the benefits?
</p>
<p>
CSS was a revolution for web development. Its most concrete benefits are:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Interface control on different documents in a single file;</li>
<li>
Control of different interfaces for different devices (responsive design);</li>
<li>
Accuracy to maintain the same interface for different browsers;</li>
<li>
Accessibility improvements with the possibility of “hiding” screen elements for users without vision problems, but keeping the same elements accessible for screen readers;</li>
<li>
Forms with a look and feel different from the standard of the operating system;
</li>
<li>
Lower bandwidth consumption for user and server;</li>
<li>
Countless dynamic techniques that could not be used in tables;</li>
</ul>
</p>
