What is URL?
</title>
<body>
<Body Bgcolor="LavenderBlush" text="#000000"> 
  
<h1 style="border:2px solid gray;"><p class="ex1">What is URL?</p></h1>
<p>
URL stands for <b>Uniform Resource Locator.</b><p>
Being straightforward, URL is the same as a web address, the text you type in your browser's address bar to access a particular page or service.

<p>However, a URL contains a series of specific information, which follow a predetermined pattern so that the user can always find the service he is looking for, as long as he types the address correctly. The URL pattern was set in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the "father" of the World Wide Web.

<p><b>Diagram of a URL</b>
<p>A URL is made up of two main parts, the schema and the path. Let's see what each one of them does:

<p>Outline
<p>
The scheme is a network protocol and the first group of characters in a URL, which are before the ":". Depending on the format, it can indicate web addresses (http, https), communication via email (mailto), file transfer between computers (ftp), communication via chats (irc) and so on.
<p>
The scheme is always typed in lowercase.

<p><b>Path</b>
<p>
The Path is the nominal address of a website itself. As a rule, all internet addresses are identified by numeric strings and the URL serves to find what we want, without having to decorate gigantic sequences of numbers.
<p>
The Path is divided into at least three parts, being the hostname (first part before the first point, such as www, for example), the site domain (the name per se, as Tecnoblog) and the top level domain, or TLD, which is the last term after the last point and before the first bar and indicates the type of the site (com, net, org ...).
<p>
For example, at https://tecnoblog.net, https is the scheme, tecnoblog is the domain and net is the TLD, with tecnoblog.net being the path.
<p>
Some website structures, such as internal links (this text, for example) receive extra calls to point to specific pages. The number that appears after ".net /", in the example given, is an index number and an identifier, while the rest is the name of the file loaded by the browser, which allows you to read this text.
