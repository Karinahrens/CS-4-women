"I don't have a knack for math" and other myths that keep girls away

School girl running from numbers
Nor does our model of education help to disconnect preconceived notions that gain space even in childhood, with a dichotomy between games and ways of being a boy and a girl. At school, this selection continues to influence their future choices. A study published in 2016 by the American Educational Research Association shows that the disparity in performance is beginning to emerge in early childhood education, reflecting cultural stereotypes.

“Are you sure you want to study this college? We don't know if you can do it. " -parents of Lucía S., 27 years old

The researchers follow two distinct groups: one of 5,000 children, who entered kindergarten in 1998, and more than 7,500 members, in 2010. They observed that the differences in mathematical skills did not change much in the two groups, which entered the pre- school separated by 12 years. Initially, both had equal mathematical skills. But a disparity logo began to be identified, and as of the middle of the year, there were more boys than girls in the group of students with the best performance. Arriving in the third grade, with difference of difference, especially among those who had better school performance.

The study also showed that the teachers considered the students' performance to be inferior to the students, even if they had grades identical to theirs. Lower expectations for girls can influence their future abilities in several ways. Fear and anxiety can be an impediment to learning. In the early years of elementary school, where the majority of teachers are female, anxiety is caused by a relationship with the mathematical consequences for girls 'performance, influencing how little girls' beliefs about who is good in the discipline. "Many choose not to pursue careers in science, technology and engineering because they lack confidence in their ability to excel in mathematics, despite having the ability and skills to exhibit it," says one of the study authors, Sian Beilock, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of Chicago, in an interview with the Program.

Another <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/389" target="_blank">work</a>, carried out by researchers from the universities of New York, Princeton and Illinois, also in the United States, investigated the behavior of children of 5, 6 and 7 years in relation to their intellectual abilities. At the age of 5, they were invited to hear a story about a “very, very intelligent” person, without any clue about the protagonist's gender. When asking who that person would be, choose someone of the same sex. From the age of 6, at least for girls, this identification begins to decrease.
</p>
<p>
The studies by psychologist Andrew Meltzoff, co-director of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences at the University of Washington, provided more information about the power of cultural stereotypes in children's learning. A survey points to similar data: “Very early, as girls incorporate false conceptions that they are not good at mathematics”, writes the authors in the article Gender Stereotypes and Mathematics in Primary School Children.
</p>
<p>
And more: the physical space can contribute to the design of them. If a room had Star Trek exhibits and is from Spock, instead of neutral items, fewer high school girls wanted to be in that environment. Using statistical statistics, Meltzoff found that they are not "owned" here.

Information related to Tel Aviv University in Israel. The authors carry out the following experiment, with three groups of students, from the 6th grade until the end of schooling: each made two identical tests, and they were corrected by two times of the teachers: one who knew the names of the students (able, therefore , deduct their gender) and one that corrects anonymous evidence. The corrections were uneven even when the responses were the same.

The time that the names gave the boys higher marks. The anonymous correction gave the girls higher marks. But this effect was observed in the subjects of Mathematics and Science - such as English tests, for example, received similarly. The researchers concluded that the documents overestimated the victims.
